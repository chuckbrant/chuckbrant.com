----------
This is just a hack up of photograma, to support Icloud as the backend, and remove journals.

Usage
============ 

###Quick Start

1. [Fork this repository](https://github.com/sunbliss/photorama/fork) to get started. 
2. Go to `https://github.com/yourusername/photorama/settings`
3. Rename the repository to your new project, e.g. *myphotoblog*
2. Create a new branch called `gh-pages` in your repository. 
3. Go to the branches directory at `https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname/branches` and *change* **default branch** to **gh-pages**.
4. Delete **master** branch. 
3. GitHub will build your site automatically and publish it at `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname/`.  

----------

- The homepage welcomes the visitors with 3 animated photos of your choice. It is recommended that all three are landscape orientated for best view.

To change the welcome content at the far left of the Home page go here: `/index.html` and fill the responding lines of the YAML with your desired text.
