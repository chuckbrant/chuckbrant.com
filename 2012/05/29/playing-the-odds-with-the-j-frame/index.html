If we need a gun, the odds are that presenting the firearm will stop the perpetrator. If the encounter goes to shots fired, the odds are the ranges will be close and the round count will be low. The odds indicate there will only be one attacker. The odds are that you will not have to shoot through cover and the evildoer will be un-armored. As you can see, the odds are that a 5 shot J-Frame in .38 Special will get it done. We play the odds everyday; you just have to figure out how much you are willing to pay, in terms of discomfort, to make the odds better for prevailing in a violent encounter. If you decide to take the middle road between carrying nothing and a full size service pistol, the J-Frame seems to be the sweet spot. I commend my friends who carry full size auto loaders, wherever they go. Two to three pounds of steel, plastic and ammo is not an easy task to lug around day after day. They are better equipped to deal with the statistical outliers of multiple attackers or prolonged gunfights. They don’t pocket carry; their pistols are way too heavy and large for that. They wear them either behind the hip or at their appendix and because of this they can present their firearm faster and more confidently than pocket carry allows. Pocket carry does have advantages in that your hand can be on the firearm and no one is the wiser, and if it’s a coat pocket, it literally can already be pointing at the suspected character, covertly. Why the J-Frame and not another small form factor option? We have come a long way from the old Browning .25 and .32 ACP pocket pistols, so options abound in .380 ACP and 9mm. The .380 ACP has come a long way in terms of stopping power with improved propellants and bullet designs, but it is not at the level of the .38 Special. These mouse guns require a very firm wrist to cycle reliably, so it is very easy to create a malfunction with them. Some bullet profiles might not feed well in some designs; extensive testing of the cartridge you plan to carry for self defense is critical. Some are so ridiculously small that getting a decent grip on them is difficult, exasperating the “limp wrist” issue. The smaller 9mm pistols are very capable handguns, and if you are willing to invest the time to train with them, they will give good service, but all semi-auto pistols have some limitation just by the very nature of their design. Rounds that don’t fire need more manipulation to fix than with a revolver where you just pull the trigger again to skip the dud. Even simply determining if the semi auto pistol is loaded required more knowledge than a simple swing out cylinder of the J-Frame. At contact distances, were the barrel is actually jammed into the target, they can be pushed out of battery by the slide moving back a little and will not fire. Anything with a slide is unlikely to get more than one round off when shooting through a jacket pocket or purse. Since the magazines of the auto loading pistol is not integral to the gun, they are more likely to be damaged, so it is prudent to carry a spare, since bad magazines are the number one cause of failure. With revolvers there is no need to manipulate a safety device to fire the weapon. Some semi-auto pistols require a safety lever to be moved in order to make the gun operable, but only you can decide if this is a good, bad or neutral. I point out these things not to suggest that an auto loader is a bad or an unreliable self-defensive firearm, just to understand that it takes more dedication to the platform to run it well. I think the old wisdom was that a J-Frame was good for a person who is only willing to casually train; this has been replaced with the auto loader in the modern thought. The J-Frame is self-evidently easier to run, just by looking at the lack of controls, of which there is only three: the trigger, ejector rod and the cylinder latch. The one thing I have not mentioned is hitting your target. The 2 inch barreled snub nose revolver does not give much of a sight radius to work with, coupled with a long heavy trigger pull and it becomes very difficult to hit at distance. Remember we are playing the odds, and they dictate that most often the attack will be up close and personal. If I’ve convinced you that a J-Frame should be in your “bag of tricks” or part of your “<a href="http://edcforums.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Every Day Carry</a>”, the question is which one? Let’s start by eliminating some traits such as exposed spur hammers and rubbery grips as these will just snag on draw. Steel guns are nice to shoot, but are a bit too heavy for front pocket carry in a pair of slacks. The .357 Magnum is punishing, especially when launched from a lightweight, short-barreled pistol creating impressive recoil and muzzle flash. Ejection of the longer .357 cases is also less sure, as the pistol already suffers from a short ejection rod, due to the short barrel length. I suggest the .38 Special, loaded with a defensive round designed specifically for the short barrel, which will help with the projectile’s velocity and reduce the flash by using a faster burning propellant. Since the cylinder will be ½ inch shorter then it’s .357 equivalent, it will lighter. This leaves us with either the Centennial or Bodyguard type in .38 special. The “Bodyguard” style is a humped back pistol, that provides a shrouded hammer that can be cocked in single action, but the biggest advantage might be that you can get a slightly high grip on the gun, which helps to reduce muzzle flip. The pre-cocking of the hammer might be useful for those long shots, but again we are playing the odds on the likelihood of needing to take that long shot, which is minimal. The “Centennial” functions as a double action only (DAO) gun with it’s consistent trigger pull. For the person who causally trains there is no question as to if they should cock or not cock the hammer which is a good thing. The most popular revolver currently made by Smith and Wesson is the Model 642 “Airweight”, which is a 1 7/8 inch barreled, .38 Special 5-shot J-frame with aluminum frame and stainless steel cylinder at 15 ounces unloaded. Because the volume of sales is high, the prices are very reasonable. Taurus makes J-Frames, and I would not hesitate to recommend them with its lifetime warranty and not just for the original owner. S&amp;W is the de facto standard for a reason; they make good functional revolvers that you can bet your life on, which is exactly what you are doing. “Five to stay alive” might be the J-Frame mantra, but 10 would be better, so how the heck to we get this thing reloaded in a fight? There are 2 ways; slow and very slow. Neither is good so don’t expect a reload, you better either finish the fight with the first 5, or go to hands, knives or any other weapon of opportunity. Loose extra rounds in your pocket are the slowest of all and not suggested when there is a little piece of rubbery plastic called a “speed strip” that will hold 5-6 cartridges for quicker loading. The method is to put 2 cartridges in at a time, and to “rip” them out of the holder this speeds up the reloads and prevents fumbling with them individually. There is another device called a “speed loader”, which is round device that can “inject” all 5 rounds into the cylinder, which is the fastest method. The problem with the speed loader is there is not much room on a J-Frame and often the grip panels can get in the way, these speed loaders work much better on the larger K-Frame pistols where the larger dimensions permit more access. So you have a J-Frame and a speed strip, what else do you need? Even if you pocket carry, you need a pocket holster. It’s a little envelope that will help prevent printing, and keep the gun clean and free from lint and grim that could cause functioning issues. The pocket holster normally has some grabby material that will help it remain in the pocket if you draw the gun. The trouser pocket should be dedicated to the gun and be separate from keys and other pocket occupants, which could get caught, or cause an unintended discharge by acting against the trigger. The standard grips (boots) on the S&amp;W are hard plastic and expose the metal back strap, which does not promote comfort. The stock grip can allow the ring finger to get bashed by the trigger guard during recoil. I find that the Taurus grip to be much nicer, and it can be purchased for the less then $10, and fits the S&amp;W J-Frame just fine. There is the option of using a <a href="http://www.t-grips.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tyler-T</a> to fill the gap between the grip and trigger guard, if you find the exposed back strap tolerable, but want something a little more hand filling without increasing the overall size. There are lasers that can be added to the side of the frame or incorporated in the grip and can add confidence at longer ranges or low light, but seem unnecessary considering the odds of needing that long shot. I also think that the front sight which can be difficult to pick up quickly benefiting from some nail polish or model paint in a contrasting color. With a little J-Frame, you should not plan on running to the sounds of gunfire. There maybe time where loved ones are at risk, and this will be required. This would not be a happy prospect with 5 shots on board. The J-Frame is in your pocket to help with some situation that you just could not avoid even following the rules of the 4Ss. Like they say, if you want to go looking for trouble, bring a rifle and a group of similarly armed friends. But is you live a quite life the J-Frame can help you get home.</p>
