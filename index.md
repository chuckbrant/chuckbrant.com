### Oct 2022 - Denver CO

We are going to Denver to see my nephew and his fiance.  They are going to be married next summer and are excited to meet the love of his life.  The weather report is encouraging, but Iâ€™m not packing my shorts and sandals, much hiking is planned.  Seeing Gryffin at Red Rocks in is on the agenda, hiking and a lot of gluten-free food as the majority of us, have celiac.

### Aug 2022 - Richmond VA 

Went to Richmond just to get out of town for the weekend and really liked it.   Basically, spend time in the Fan neighborhood and down at the James River.  There is a lot to do, great food and a good vibe.  We did a canal and tolley tour and spent time on a few of the islands in the James River and walked the "pipe walk".  Saw the reamins of the Civil War POW camp and lots of street art. There was a bakery less than a 100 yards from our Air BnB what had gluten free treats.

### October 2021 - Hendersonville

We had a quick overnight visit to Sasha.  We visited a couple of parks, a sunflower field with 20 varieties.  We ate at a great food truck and just had a great visit.  We also had to drive Sasha's CRV back to home to have brake work done and did not stop well.
