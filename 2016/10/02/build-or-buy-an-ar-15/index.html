                <p><a href="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SW-Sport2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/SW-Sport2.png" alt="sw-sport2"></a>I friend just asked about getting a new economical AR. “What I’m looking for at first is pretty much everything the <a href="http://www.gunbuyer.com/p-58570-smith-and-wesson-mp-15-sport-ii-556mm-16-barrel-301-10202.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;W M&amp;P15 Sport II</a> has - short barrel, adjustable stock, magpul flip sight and sling mount points. BUT, I would want to replace the hand guard with a rail system so I can mount a flashlight. I’d also want to eventually accessorize with a red dot sight.” So first let’s looks at the <a href="http://www.gunbuyer.com/p-58570-smith-and-wesson-mp-15-sport-ii-556mm-16-barrel-301-10202.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;W M&amp;P15 Sport II </a>, it has a very inexpensive, with street price of $619.  There are a couple of items that I’m not a big fan of like the carbine gas length which is not as soft shooting as the mid-length and  provides less room for hands and accessories.  The barrel is 1 in 9 twist, makes 77gr a no go, and really ideal for 55gr.  On the positive side, 1 in 9 should be good got .22lr plinking with a <a href="https://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/ar-15-22-lr-conversion-kit-jonathan-arthur-ciener-inc-includes-10-round-magazine-arr-059.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">22 conversion kit</a>, if that is a future choice he might make, and makes the gun a do everything, but nothing well rifle. I really like <a href="https://www.cheaperthandirt.com/product/cmmg-bravo-rimfire-conversion-kit-ar-15-22-long-rifle-25-round-magazine-matte-gray-22ba6e1-852005002356.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palmetto State Armory</a> as my go to vendor for AR-15 crap.  They do a lot of daily specials, and it really pays to get there <a href="https://palmettostatearmory.com/customer/account/login/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">email blasts daily</a> and just keep an eye out.  What I did today was look at what they have today, if I was going to put a budget AR-15 together today (October 2, 2016). I found a <a href="http://palmettostatearmory.com/blem-psa-ar15-moe-ept-lower-black.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complete lower</a> with, Moe Magpul furniture, <a href="http://palmettostatearmory.com/psa-ar15-pa10-enhanced-polished-trigger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PSA enhanced trigger</a> which is a GI trigger that has been polished on the contact surfaces and coat in a slick nickel finish. This is a significant upgrade.  It’s not my favorite MOE stock, as it does not have the friction lock, but the trigger is a great no nonsense, better then GI trigger upgrade.</p>
<h2 id="169-99"><a href="#169-99" class="headerlink" title="$ 169.99"></a><strong>$ 169.99</strong></h2><p><img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-02-at-5.49.18-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-10-02 at 5.49.18 PM.png">   Now, if my buddy just wants to hang a flashlight on his rifle, then there is no needs to go with an aluminum rail, a MOE hand guard that takes m-lok rail pieces could easily hold his flashlight.  With a white light there is no need for the perfect alignment that a laser needs, so being off a degree or two is OK.  This has a 416R stainless steel mid-length 1 in 7 twist barrel.  <a href="http://thearguys.com/ar-facts/differences-ar-15-barrel-metals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read this article</a> on steels used in AR-15 barrels, the short version is go with the 416.  416 is rust resistant and more accurate, the only time I would go chrome lined 4150 would be if it’s a go to war rifle, never going to get cleaned and going bang and ejecting is more important than accuracy. <strong>$219.99</strong> <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-02-at-5.55.11-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-10-02 at 5.55.11 PM.png">   Now we are still missing a couple of parts, a charging handle, bolt carrier group and a rear sight.  The <a href="http://www.gunbuyer.com/p-58570-smith-and-wesson-mp-15-sport-ii-556mm-16-barrel-301-10202.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;W M&amp;P15 Sport II</a> says nothing about it’s charging handle (can’t tell if it is 7075 or 6016, which would not be as good) or BCG, but both seem of good quality from what I can tell from other reviews online.  This is what we care about in the BCG: Properly Staked Gas Key, Extractor Spring and proper insert, Shot Peened Bolt, (HPT) High Pressure Tested &amp; (MPI) Magnetic Particle Inspection.  In the charging handle we want it to be forged, not extruded. A <a href="http://palmettostatearmory.com/psa-5-56-full-auto-nib-premium-bcg-logo-blem-psa-ar15-m16-7075-t6-forged-mil-spec-charging-handle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boron coated BCG</a> with forged charging handle, this would be easier to clean and MAY require a little less lubrication, it contains the o-ring insert that helps with tension on the exactor, and seems to have what we want in a good BCG. Charging handle is good to go.</p>
<h2 id="129-99"><a href="#129-99" class="headerlink" title="$129.99"></a>$129.99</h2><p><img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Screen-Shot-2016-10-02-at-6.15.59-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-10-02 at 6.15.59 PM.png">   So, we are at $520 and still need to purchase a rear BUIS (Back up Iron Site).  You could pick up a <a href="http://palmettostatearmory.com/magpul-mbus-back-up-sight-gen-2-rear-mag248.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magpul MBUS Gen 2 for $55 from PSA</a>.  You could also consider a carry handle if you want to be able to quickly zero it for different ammo or do any “appleseed style shooting” and you are not going to put a red-dot or other optic on it, or a least a fixed rear sight that still leaves room for a red-dot, like the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01CA5SIXI?psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Green Blob :-)</a> for $17. So for less than $600 you can get a better rifle than the <a href="http://www.gunbuyer.com/p-58570-smith-and-wesson-mp-15-sport-ii-556mm-16-barrel-301-10202.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S&amp;W M&amp;P15 Sport II</a> and not have to assemble anything other then 2 push pins that hold the lower and upper together. If you are already paying shipping you can pick up your M-LOC accessories from PSA also and just be done with it, or go the Chinese e-bay route, a rail for airsoft is a fine place here to cut corners.  If you go with the Green Blob you will have about $550 in a great rifle, that will need optic/sight upgrades in the future, but the rifle itself is a serious upgrade from the S&amp;W and you will have something that you can shoot right away as you research optics……</p>
