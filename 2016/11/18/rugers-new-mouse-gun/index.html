                <p><img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_6363-2.jpg" alt="img_6363">This was shot at 9 yards from the plate, this is rotated 90 degrees so really windage was great and represents a little vertical stringing.  The ammo used is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2YKzpYm9hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fiocchi’s excellent XTP .380</a> with cases that are nickel plated. The new Ruger LCP II is the latest iteration of what started as the Kel-Tec P3AT, that I also own. Just a little about the pistol, it is a locked breach .380ACP, with a Glock style trigger, American magazine release button, pretty decent fixed sights and a polymer frame that contains 6 rounds in a well made magazine plus one up the pipe. The pistol benefits from a little paint on the front sight, but they are vastly superior to those on the 3PAT.  I know some will say this a point and shoot firearm, but it’s better to have and not need, then to need for that 10 yard hostage taking head shot and not have.  My understanding is that the custom model had better sights, but are a bit bigger and could snag on the way out of a pocket. This is not a gun that you wear on the hip, if you are going to carry a proper holster then you can carry a proper pistol (definite as 9mm or better), this is built for pocket carry.  Were a G26 or Shield ride well in an IWB, this is a deep concealment pistol.  I have a buddy who calls this type of gun, “the gun you carry when you aren’t armed.” This gun is a joy at the range, with its slide hold open after the last round is expended, but this would only help a licensed conceal carrier, if they carry an extra magazine.  Ruger only ships this with one magazine, so you have to purchase additional magazines.  It’s recoil is very manageable and has a very nice trigger that leads to accurate shooting. The pistol’s dimensions are similar to the earlier models, but it feel more substantial and has a little bigger volume in the pocket, particularly in the grip.  This slightly wider and more angular grip spread out recoil and makes the little mouse gun much more shootable, but concealment is a tiny bit harder, but still not difficult. <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/holster.png" alt="holster"> Since this is a pocket gun, a pocket holster is a requirement, as the trigger breaks at about 6 pounds and has no manual safety.  The <a href="http://www.boraii.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boraii</a> is a little trigger guard holster, that allows you to manipulate the slide and magazine release, but provides you a hook to catch your pocket.  If you don’t trust catching the pocket corner on the draw, then you can also add a piece of paracord and loop it on your belt.  Only time will tell how the exposed slide wears, if rust or lost of finish become and issue. I did shoot this size-by-side with my decade old Kel-Tec P3AT and there was no practical accuracy out to about 7 yard, beyond that distance the new Ruger really started to shine.  50 rounds a session is my limit for the Kel-Tec, where as I could shot the Ruger all day long. Street price is less than $300 and if you don’t have a flat little pocket pistol this would be an excellent option.  If you are leaving the house unarmed because you don’t feel like strapping on a pistol and your trusty J-Frame is just too big, this is the one for you.  Speaking of J-Frames, yes the .38 Special has a slight edge, but this has 2 more rounds and a quicker reload.  The XTP bullets will do 12 inches in bare or  denim covered jello with moderate expansion, but is only slinging a 95gr projectile compared to 125gr.  This is still way better than a sharp stick or pocket knife. I’ve only had 2 range sessions with it, so time will tell if any issues crop up, but it seems like a well build little pistol, and Ruger’s customer service has been very good to me and those I know who have had to use it. From the American Rifle magazine, they found accuracy to be incredible, 1 inch at 7 yards from a pocket pistol. Now none of the ammo tested is that I would use in this pistol, as none are launching the controlled penetration XTP which allows these short barreled pistols to go 12-18 inches as suggested by the FBI protocols for reaching vital organs. <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/LCP_II_Accuracy.png" alt="LCP_II_Accuracy.png"></p>
