I have done a previous post on <a href="http://antebellumending.com/2013/11/turning-ballistic-water-into-wine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">turning bird shot into slugs</a>, this time I’m going to talk about turning bird shot into buck shot. Buck shot comes in various sizes, and the most normal is #00 Buck (pronounced “double-ought”), it is .330” in diameter. I’m actually loading #0 Buck (single ought) which is .320 of an inch and works well also as a gallery load for my Nagant, that runs .313 bore diameter. I do a future post on gallery shooting and loading for that. Basically, the same motivation exists here as with slugs, it provides you a cheap practice alternative to $1 per shot, buck shot and could provide help to your neighbor who has that 500 of bird shot, and needs to turn it into something more ballistically capable in a time of social distress.  Your neighbors might be your best defense against looting and other social ills.  Even your Fudd neighbor can be helpful with the bird/skeet gun, if we fill it up with something more potent than #7.5 field shot.  Remember to verify or remove the choke, a hack saw might be the best option (remember to keep it to 18.5 inches, if that kind of thing still matters then). When melting lead, always wear protective gear, like goggles and gloves in a well ventilated area, this is doubly important during times where medical care might not be available. <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4488-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4488-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg"> The buck shot mold I’m using is a <a href="http://buckshotmold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sharp Shooters Mold</a> and it is not well designed. You really have to wear heavy welders gloved with it or you would be burned. There is a wooden handle that only covers metal on 3 sides, and there is no way to pry the mold open with out touching metal, and it just flops open. It was cheaper than the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Lee-Precision-Buck-Shot-18-Mold/dp/B005Y50H5O" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lee #00 buck mold</a> and was available in the rather odder size of single-ought that I wanted. Remember that the Lee model does not come with handles and they need to be ordered separately. I you want just to cast for your 12 gauge, just get the Lee Mold and handles, you will not regret it. I water drop everything I cast, the thought is that is creates a little harder skin on the pellet, I don’t know if that really matters in a shotgun, where you are driving them down the bore in a shot cup, and of course no lubing is required. I’m also less critical of the pellet being perfect for the shotgun as I am with a bullet for a rifle or pistol.  The pellet is going to have a little numb from where it is cut, and a wrinkle in the pellet might be a sign of my unprofessionalism, but should not effect performance in any meaningful way. <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4489-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4489-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg"> The shot will be on a spruce, and all you need to do is take a pair of diagonal cutter, and snip them free, soon you’ll have a bowl of shot. <a href="http://antebellumending.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wpid-IMG_4491-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4491-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4491-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg"></a> <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4494-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4494-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg"> <a href="http://antebellumending.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/wpid-IMG_4492-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4492-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4492-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg"></a> Unlike what we did for loading slug, there is no reason to cut the crimp free. All you need it to pick open the crimp, large enough to pour out the bird shot, and stick 9 pellets in. <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4495-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4495-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg">By hand start to work the crimp, back into place, If you have a drill press, you can use it just as a press, but a bolt in with a pan head in to help put the crimp back in place. You might have to roll the shell on a hard surface, to reform the very top, as it might get a little munged up when you opened up the crimp. <a href="http://www.dave-cushman.net/shot/shotshellloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The size of a 12 gauge shotgun bore is .729 on an inch, but with a chamber of .800</a>, and the inside diameter of a piece of 3/4 inch Schedule 40 pipe is .804. I needs to fit a piece of Schedule 40 pipe with room to spare, if it does not fail out under it’s own weight you have a problem. I have yet to have a shell fail to feed, in over 300 rounds, but it is your responsibility to make sure the shells work in your shotgun. In normal times, always use purposely build Buck for self defense, this is a cheap way to practice and might become valuable to be able to do in not so normal times. You can always use overshot card, it has the advantage of being a cleaner reload, in the sense that there is less deformation of the mouth of the shell, and if the card is clear, it’s easy to see that it is buck shot. If I was loading in a situation that I would call, austere, I would not bother. Once you have created the pellets, you can do all the reloading with a 10 penny nail and some hand strength. <img src="http://chuckbrant.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4496-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg" alt="wpid-wpid-wpid-IMG_4496-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24-2014-09-5-11-24.jpg"> Lastly, don’t forget to mark them, I use a “B”, for these, since they don’t have a clear over shot card that you can see the payload. Loading bird shot, when you are expecting buck (or vise a versa) could be dangerous to other, in the case of skeet, or to you in the case of self defense. I hope this encourages some of you to get a mold and learn how to use it.  For your neighborhood, this could make it a much harder target to looters, which in turn provides you and yours some additional security.  It also provides a cheap way to practice with that scatter gun of yours collecting dust in the closet.</p>
