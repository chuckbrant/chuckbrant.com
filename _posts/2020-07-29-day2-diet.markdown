title: Day 2 of my Water Fast
description: |
---
  The ball of my left foot is acting up a little, I'm hoping it's all about the detox.  Hunger level is OK, having not eaten now for 36 hours.  I drank about a gallon of water yesterday, and today I added some Magnesium and Potassium.  I was expecting decaffeinated head aches, but so far so good.  I'm off tomorrow and the weekend, so today is my last day of work for the week, I thought I would have more issues focusing, bit that does seem to be an unwarranted worry.  We are so used to eating 3 meals a day with snacks in between, but the more I read, and just think about it, our ancestors did not have the food security we have today.
