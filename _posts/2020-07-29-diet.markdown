title: Started a Water Fast today.
description: |
---
  I've read a lot of benefits of a water fast.  It got me intrigued enough to try it.  My goal is 14 days at which time I will reintroduce some fruits and vegetable.  I'm hoping for some weight loss and to clear up some lingering joint issues.  This idea of your body doing garbage collection after it goes into ketosis is supposed to be where the major benefit comes in.
