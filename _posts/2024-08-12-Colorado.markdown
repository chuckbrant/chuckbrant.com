The Big Red Suitcases are all packed and ready to go.  Wendi and I are looking forward to going to Greece, seeing the country, and spending time with my sister and brother-in-law.  This will be the longest vacation I have been on since my honeymoon, and Iâ€™m hoping to unplug quickly.  That transition between work and vacation is something that I have not always done well.
